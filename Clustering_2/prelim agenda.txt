Agenda

1. Beyond k-means: prob, Dbscan

2. Cluster eval: Recap, Davies Bouldin, cf. Phillips Paper for more?

3. Dimensionality reduction
Feature Selection (search based on cluster eval? + FeatureImpCluster)
Feature mapping (run hclust on the features!)

4. Outlier detection
kmeans
lowest probabilities

5. missings -> mice

6. Unknown categories [likely too much]
